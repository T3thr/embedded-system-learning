Bit 7 – ICNC1 Input Capture Noise Canceler
Writing this bit to '1' activates the input capture noise canceler. When the noise canceler is activated, the
input from the Input Capture pin (ICP1) is filtered. The filter function requires four successive equal
valued samples of the ICP1 pin for changing its output. The input capture is therefore delayed by four
oscillator cycles when the noise canceler is enabled.
Bit 6 – ICES1 Input Capture Edge Select
This bit selects which edge on the Input Capture pin (ICP1) that is used to trigger a capture event. When
the ICES1 bit is written to zero, a falling (negative) edge is used as a trigger, and when the ICES1 bit is
written to '1', a rising (positive) edge will trigger the capture.
When a capture is triggered according to the ICES1 setting, the counter value is copied into the Input
Capture Register (ICR1). The event will also set the Input Capture Flag (ICF1) and this can be used to
cause an input capture interrupt, if this interrupt is enabled.
When the ICR1 is used as TOP value (see description of the WGM1[3:0] bits located in the TCCR1A and
the TCCR1B register), the ICP1 is disconnected and consequently, the input capture function is disabled.
Bits 3, 4 – WGM1 Waveform Generation Mode
Refer to TCCR1A.
Bits 2:0 – CS1[2:0] Clock Select 1
The three clock select bits select the clock source to be used by the timer/counter. Refer to Figure 20-10

Bits 6, 7 – FOC1 Force Output Compare for Channel B and A
The FOC1A/FOC1B bits are only active when the WGM1[3:0] bits specifies a non-PWM mode. When
writing a logical one to the FOC1A/FOC1B bit, an immediate compare match is forced on the waveform
generation unit. The OC1A/OC1B output is changed according to its COM1x[1:0] bits setting. Note that
the FOC1A/FOC1B bits are implemented as strobes. Therefore it is the value present in the COM1x[1:0]
bits that determine the effect of the forced compare.
A FOC1A/FOC1B strobe will not generate any interrupt nor will it clear the timer in Clear Timer on
Compare Match (CTC) mode using OCR1A as TOP. The FOC1A/FOC1B bits are always read as zero.

Bits 15:0 – TCNT1[15:0] Timer/Counter 1 Counter Value
The two Timer/Counter I/O locations (TCNT1H and TCNT1L, combined TCNT1) give direct access, both
for read and for write operations, to the timer/counter unit 16-bit counter. To ensure that both the high and
low bytes are read and written simultaneously when the CPU accesses these registers, the access is
performed using an 8-bit temporary high byte register (TEMP). This temporary register is shared by all the
other 16-bit registers. Refer to Accessing 16-bit Timer/Counter Registers for details.
Modifying the counter (TCNT1) while the counter is running introduces a risk of missing a compare match
between TCNT1 and one of the OCR1x registers.
Writing to the TCNT1 register blocks (removes) the compare match on the following timer clock for all
compare units.

Bits 15:0 – ICR1[15:0] Input Capture 1
The input capture is updated with the counter (TCNT1) value each time an event occurs on the ICP1 pin
(or optionally on the analog comparator output for Timer/Counter1). The input capture can be used for
defining the counter TOP value.
The Input Capture register is 16-bit in size. To ensure that both the high and low bytes are read
simultaneously when the CPU accesses these registers, the access is performed using an 8-bit
temporary High Byte register (TEMP). This temporary register is shared by all the other 16-bit registers.
Refer to Accessing 16-bit Timer/Counter Registers for details.

Bits 15:0 – OCR1A[15:0] Output Compare 1 A
The Output Compare registers contain a 16-bit value that is continuously compared with the counter
value (TCNT1). A match can be used to generate an output compare interrupt or to generate a waveform
output on the OC1A pin.
The Output Compare registers are 16-bit in size. To ensure that both the high and low bytes are written
simultaneously when the CPU writes to these registers, the access is performed using an 8-bit temporary
High Byte Register (TEMP). This temporary register is shared by all the other 16-bit registers. Refer to

Bit 5 – ICF1 Timer/Counter 1, Input Capture Flag
This flag is set when a capture event occurs on the ICP1 pin. When the Input Capture Register (ICR1) is
set by the WGM1[3:0] to be used as the TOP value, the ICF1 flag is set when the counter reaches the
TOP value.
ICF1 is automatically cleared when the input capture interrupt vector is executed. Alternatively, ICF1 can
be cleared by writing a logic one to its bit location.
Bit 2 – OCF1B Timer/Counter 1, Output Compare B Match Flag
This flag is set in the timer clock cycle after the counter (TCNT1) value matches the Output Compare
Register B (OCR1B).
Note that a Forced Output Compare (FOC1B) strobe will not set the OCF1B flag.
OCF1B is automatically cleared when the output compare match B interrupt vector is executed.
Alternatively, OCF1B can be cleared by writing a logic one to its bit location.
Bit 1 – OCF1A Timer/Counter 1, Output Compare A Match Flag
This flag is set in the timer clock cycle after the counter (TCNT1) value matches the Output Compare
Register A (OCR1A).
Note that a Forced Output Compare (FOC1A) strobe will not set the OCF1A flag.
OCF1A is automatically cleared when the output compare match A interrupt vector is executed.
Alternatively, OCF1A can be cleared by writing a logic one to its bit location.
Bit 0 – TOV1 Timer/Counter 1, Overflow Flag
The setting of this flag is dependent on the WGM1[3:0] bits setting. In Normal and CTC modes, the TOV1
flag is set when the timer overflows. Refer to the Waveform Generation mode bit description for the TOV1
flag behavior when using another WGM1[3:0] bit setting.
TOV1 is automatically cleared when the timer/counter 1 overflow interrupt vector is executed.
Alternatively, TOV1 can be cleared by writing a logic one to its bit location.

Timer/Counter 0, 1 Prescalers
The 8-bit Timer/Counter0 (TC0) and the 16-bit Timer/Counter1 (TC1) share the same prescaler module,
but the timer/counters can have different prescaler settings. The following description applies to TC0,
TC1.

16-bit Timer/Counter1 (TC1) with PWM
21.1
Internal Clock Source
The timer/counter can be clocked directly by the system clock (by setting the CSn[2:0]=0x01). This
provides the fastest operation, with a maximum timer/counter clock frequency equal to system clock
frequency (fCLK_I/O). Alternatively, one of four taps from the prescaler can be used as a clock source. The
prescaled clock has a frequency of either fCLK_I/O/8, fCLK_I/O/64, fCLK_I/O/256, or fCLK_I/O/1024.
21.2
Prescaler Reset
The prescaler is free-running, i.e., it operates independently of the clock select logic of the timer/counter,
and it is shared by timer/counter1 and timer/counter0. Since the prescaler is not affected by the timer/
counter’s clock select, the state of the prescaler will have implications for situations where a prescaled
clock is used. One example of prescaling artifacts occurs when the timer is enabled and clocked by the
prescaler (0x06 > CSn[2:0] > 0x01). The number of system clock cycles from when the timer is enabled to
the first count occurs can be from 1 to N+1 system clock cycles, where N equals the prescaler divisor (8,
64, 256, or 1024).
It is possible to use the prescaler Reset for synchronizing the timer/counter to program execution.
However, care must be taken if the other timer/counter that shares the same prescaler also uses
prescaling. A prescaler Reset will affect the prescaler period for all timer/counters it is connected to.
21.3
External Clock Source
An external clock source applied to the T1/T0 pin can be used as timer/counter clock (clkT1/clkT0). The
T1/T0 pin is sampled once every system clock cycle by the pin synchronization logic. The synchronized
(sampled) signal is then passed through the edge detector. See the block diagram of the T1/T0
synchronization and edge detector logic below. The registers are clocked at the positive edge of the
internal system clock (clkI/O). The latch is transparent in the high period of the internal system clock.
The edge detector generates one clkT1/clkT0 pulse for each positive (CSn[2:0]=0x7) or negative
(CSn[2:0]=0x6) edge it detects.

The synchronization and edge detector logic introduces a delay of 2.5 to 3.5 system clock cycles from an
edge has been applied to the T1/T0 pin to the counter is updated.
Enabling and disabling of the clock input must be done when T1/T0 has been stable for at least one
system clock cycle, otherwise it is a risk that a false timer/counter clock pulse is generated.
Each half period of the external clock applied must be longer than one system clock cycle to ensure
correct sampling. The external clock must be guaranteed to have less than half the system clock
frequency (fTn < fclk_I/O/2) given a 50% duty cycle. Since the edge detector uses sampling, the maximum
frequency of an external clock it can detect is half the sampling frequency (Nyquist sampling theorem).
However, due to variation of the system clock frequency and duty cycle caused by the tolerances of the
oscillator source (crystal, resonator, and capacitors), it is recommended that maximum frequency of an
external clock source is less than fclk_I/O/2.5.
An external clock source cannot be prescaled.

General Timer/Counter Control Register
Name:
GTCCR
Offset:
0x43
Reset:
0x00
Property:  When addressing as I/O register: address offset is 0x23
When addressing I/O registers as data space using LD and ST instructions, the provided offset must be
used. When using the I/O specific commands IN and OUT, the offset is reduced by 0x20, resulting in an
I/O address offset within 0x00 - 0x3F.

Bit 7 – TSM Timer/Counter Synchronization Mode
Writing the TSM bit to one activates the Timer/Counter Synchronization mode. In this mode, the value
that is written to the PSRASY and PSRSYNC bits is kept, hence keeping the corresponding prescaler
Reset signals asserted. This ensures that the corresponding timer/counters are halted and can be
configured to the same value without the risk of one of them advancing during configuration. When the
TSM bit is written to zero, the PSRASY and PSRSYNC bits are cleared by hardware, and the timer/
counters start counting simultaneously.
Bit 1 – PSRASY Prescaler Reset Timer/Counter2
When this bit is one, the timer/counter2 prescaler will be reset. This bit is normally cleared immediately by
hardware. If the bit is written when timer/counter2 is operating in Asynchronous mode, the bit will remain
one until the prescaler has been Reset. The bit will not be cleared by hardware if the TSM bit is set.
Bit 0 – PSRSYNC Prescaler Reset
When this bit is one, timer/counter 0, 1 prescaler will be Reset. This bit is normally cleared immediately by
hardware, except if the TSM bit is set. Note that timer/counter 0, 1 share the same prescaler and a Reset
of this prescaler will affect the mentioned timers.

*Description*: Hardware reference table detailing register bit field settings, electrical operating limits, or memory configurations for Table 22-1.

> **Table 22-1**

Table 22-1. Definitions
Constant Description
BOTTOM The counter reaches the BOTTOM when it becomes zero (0x00).
MAX
The counter reaches its maximum when it becomes 0xFF (decimal 255).
TOP
The counter reaches the TOP when it becomes equal to the highest value in the count
sequence. The TOP value can be assigned to be the fixed value 0xFF (MAX) or the value
stored in the OCR2A Register. The assignment is dependent on the mode of operation.
22.2.2
Registers
The Timer/Counter (TCNT2) and Output Compare Register (OCR2A and OCR2B) are 8-bit registers.
Interrupt request (shorten as Int.Req.) signals are all visible in the Timer Interrupt Flag Register (TIFR2).
All interrupts are individually masked with the Timer Interrupt Mask register (TIMSK2). TIFR2 and
TIMSK2 are not shown in the figure.
The timer/counter can be clocked internally, via the prescaler, or asynchronously clocked from the
TOSC1/2 pins, as detailed later in this section. The asynchronous operation is controlled by the
Asynchronous Status Register (ASSR). The clock select logic block controls which clock source the timer/
counter uses to increment (or decrement) its value. The timer/counter is inactive when no clock source is
selected. The output from the clock select logic is referred to as the timer clock (clkT2).
The double buffered Output Compare Register (OCR2A and OCR2B) are compared with the timer/
counter value at all times. The result of the compare can be used by the waveform generator to generate
a PWM or variable frequency output on the Output Compare pins (OC2A and OC2B). See Output
Compare Unit for details. The compare match event will also set the Compare Flag (OCF2A or OCF2B),
which can be used to generate an output compare interrupt request.
22.3
Timer/Counter Clock Sources
The timer/counter can be clocked by an internal synchronous or an external asynchronous clock source:
The clock source clkT2 is by default equal/synchronous to the MCU clock, clkI/O.
When the Asynchronous TC2 bit in the Asynchronous Status Register (ASSR.AS2) is written to '1', the
clock source is taken from the Timer/Counter Oscillator connected to TOSC1 and TOSC2.
For details on asynchronous operation, see the description of the ASSR. For details on clock sources and
prescaler, see Timer/Counter Prescaler.
22.4
Counter Unit
The main part of the 8-bit timer/counter is the programmable bi-directional counter unit. Below is the block
diagram of the counter and its surroundings.

Increment or decrement TCNT2 by 1.

Clear TCNT2 (set all bits to zero).
clkTn
Timer/counter clock, referred to as clkT2 in the following.
top
Signalizes that TCNT2 has reached maximum value.
bottom
Signalizes that TCNT2 has reached minimum value (zero).
Depending on the mode of operation used, the counter is cleared, incremented, or decremented at each
timer clock (clkT2). clkT2 can be generated from an external or internal clock source, selected by the Clock
Select bits (CS2[2:0]). When no clock source is selected (CS2[2:0]=0x0) the timer is stopped. However,
the TCNT2 value can be accessed by the CPU, regardless of whether clkT2 is present or not. A CPU write
overrides (has priority over) all counter clear or count operations.
The counting sequence is determined by the setting of the WGM21 and WGM20 bits located in the Timer/
Counter Control Register (TCCR2A) and the WGM22 bit located in the Timer/Counter Control Register B
(TCCR2B). There are close connections between how the counter behaves (counts) and how waveforms
are generated on the Output Compare outputs OC2A and OC2B. For more details about advanced
counting sequences and waveform generation, see Modes of Operation.
The Timer/Counter Overflow Flag (TOV2) is set according to the mode of operation selected by the
TCC2B.WGM2[2:0] bits. TOV2 can be used for generating a CPU interrupt.
22.5
Output Compare Unit
The 8-bit comparator continuously compares TCNT2 with the Output Compare Register (OCR2A and
OCR2B). Whenever TCNT2 equals OCR2A or OCR2B, the comparator signals a match. A match will set
the Output Compare Flag (OCF2A or OCF2B) at the next timer clock cycle. If the corresponding interrupt
is enabled, the output compare flag generates an output compare interrupt. The output compare flag is
automatically cleared when the interrupt is executed. Alternatively, the output compare flag can be
cleared by software by writing a logical one to its I/O bit location. The waveform generator uses the match
signal to generate an output according to operating mode set by the WGM2[2:0] bits and Compare
Output mode (COM2x[1:0]) bits. The max and bottom signals are used by the waveform generator for
handling the special cases of the extreme values in some modes of operation (See Modes of Operation).

The OCR2x is double buffered when using any of the Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) modes. For the
Normal and Clear Timer on Compare (CTC) modes of operation, the double buffering is disabled. The
double buffering synchronizes the update of the OCR2x to either top or bottom of the counting sequence.
The synchronization prevents the occurrence of odd-length, non-symmetrical PWM pulses, thereby
making the output glitch-free.
The OCR2x access may seem complex, but this is not the case. When the double buffering is enabled,
the CPU has access to the OCR2x buffer register, and if double buffering is disabled the CPU will access
the OCR2x directly.

Modes of Operation
22.5.1
Force Output Compare
In non-PWM Waveform Generation modes, the match output of the comparator can be forced by writing a
one to the Force Output Compare (FOC2x) bit. Forcing compare match will not set the OCF2x flag or
reload/clear the timer, but the OC2x pin will be updated as if a real compare match had occurred (the
COM2x[1:0] bits settings define whether the OC2x pin is set, cleared or toggled).
22.5.2
Compare Match Blocking by TCNT2 Write
All CPU write operations to the TCNT2 register will block any compare match that occurs in the next timer
clock cycle, even when the timer is stopped. This feature allows OCR2x to be initialized to the same
value as TCNT2 without triggering an interrupt when the timer/counter clock is enabled.

*Description*: Technical diagram and schematic illustration detailing hardware circuit topology, signal routing, and logic operations for Figure 22-4.

> **Figure 22-4**

22.5.3
Using the Output Compare Unit
Since writing TCNT2 in any mode of operation will block all compare matches for one timer clock cycle,
there are risks involved when changing TCNT2 when using the output compare channel, independently of
whether the Timer/Counter is running or not. If the value written to TCNT2 equals the OCR2x value, the
compare match will be missed, resulting in incorrect waveform generation. Similarly, do not write the
TCNT2 value equal to BOTTOM when the counter is counting down.
The setup of the OC2x should be performed before setting the data direction register for the port pin to
output. The easiest way of setting the OC2x value is to use the Force Output Compare (FOC2x) strobe
bit in Normal mode. The OC2x register keeps its value even when changing between Waveform
Generation modes.
Be aware that the COM2x[1:0] bits are not double buffered together with the compare value. Changing
the COM2x[1:0] bits will take effect immediately.
22.6
Compare Match Output Unit
The Compare Output mode (COM2x[1:0]) bits have two functions. The waveform generator uses the
COM2x[1:0] bits for defining the Output Compare (OC2x) state at the next compare match. Also, the
COM2x[1:0] bits control the OC2x pin output source. The following figure shows a simplified schematic of
the logic affected by the COM2x[1:0] bit setting. The I/O registers, I/O bits, and I/O pins in the figure are
shown in bold. Only the parts of the general I/O Port Control registers (DDR and PORT) that are affected
by the COM2x[1:0] bits are shown. When referring to the OC2x state, the reference is for the internal
OC2x register, not the OC2x pin.

The general I/O port function is overridden by the Output Compare (OC2x) from the waveform generator
if either of the COM2x1:0 bits are set. However, the OC2x pin direction (input or output) is still controlled
by the Data Direction Register (DDR) for the port pin. The DDR bit for the OC2x pin (DDR_OC2x) must
be set as output before the OC2x value is visible on the pin. The port override function is independent of
the Waveform Generation mode.

### [PDF Page 196]

The design of the output compare pin logic allows initialization of the OC2x state before the output is
enabled. Note that some COM2x[1:0] bit settings are reserved for certain modes of operation. See

### Register Description.

Modes of Operation
22.6.1
Compare Output Mode and Waveform Generation
The waveform generator uses the COM2x[1:0] bits differently in normal, CTC, and PWM modes. For all
modes, setting the COM2x[1:0] = 0 tells the waveform generator that no action on the OC2x register is to
be performed on the next compare match. Refer also to the descriptions of the output modes.
A change of the COM2x[1:0] bits state will have effect at the first compare match after the bits are written.
For non-PWM modes, the action can be forced to have an immediate effect by using the FOC2x strobe
bits.
22.7
Modes of Operation
The mode of operation, i.e., the behavior of the timer/counter and the output compare pins, is defined by
the combination of the Waveform Generation mode (WGM2[2:0]) and Compare Output mode
(COM2x[1:0]) bits. The Compare Output mode bits do not affect the counting sequence, while the
Waveform Generation mode bits do. The COM2x[1:0] bits control whether the PWM output generated
should be inverted or not (inverted or non-inverted PWM). For non-PWM modes, the COM2x[1:0] bits
control whether the output should be set, cleared, or toggled at a compare match (See Compare Match
Output Unit).
For detailed timing information refer to Timer/Counter Timing Diagrams.
22.7.1
Normal Mode
The simplest mode of operation is the Normal mode (WGM2[2:0] = 0). In this mode, the counting direction
is always up (incrementing), and no counter clear is performed. The counter simply overruns when it
passes its maximum 8-bit value (TOP = 0xFF) and then restarts from the bottom (0x00). In normal
operation, the Timer/Counter Overflow Flag (TOV2) will be set in the same timer clock cycle as the
TCNT2 becomes zero. The TOV2 flag, in this case, behaves like a ninth bit, except that it is only set, not
cleared. However, combined with the timer overflow interrupt that automatically clears the TOV2 flag, the
timer resolution can be increased by software. There are no special cases to consider in the Normal
mode, a new counter value can be written anytime.
The output compare unit can be used to generate interrupts at some given time. Using the output
compare to generate waveforms in Normal mode is not recommended since this will occupy too much of
the CPU time.
22.7.2
Clear Timer on Compare Match (CTC) Mode
In Clear Timer on Compare or CTC mode (WGM2[2:0] = 2), the OCR2A Register is used to manipulate
the counter resolution. In CTC mode the counter is cleared to zero when the counter value (TCNT2)
matches the OCR2A. The OCR2A defines the top value for the counter, hence also its resolution. This
mode allows greater control of the compare match output frequency. It also simplifies the operation of
counting external events.
The timing diagram for the CTC mode is as follows. The counter value (TCNT2) increases until a
compare match occurs between TCNT2 and OCR2A, and then counter (TCNT2) is cleared.

Figure 22-5. CTC Mode, Timing Diagram
An interrupt can be generated each time the counter value reaches the TOP value by using the OCF2A
Flag. If the interrupt is enabled, the interrupt handler routine can be used for updating the TOP value.
However, changing TOP to a value close to BOTTOM when the counter is running with none or a low
prescaler value must be done with care since the CTC mode does not have the double buffering feature.
If the new value written to OCR2A is lower than the current value of TCNT2, the counter will miss the
compare match. The counter will then have to count to its maximum value (0xFF) and wrap around
starting at 0x00 before the compare match can occur.
For generating a waveform output in CTC mode, the OC2A output can be set to toggle its logical level on
each compare match by setting the Compare Output mode bits to toggle mode (COM2A[1:0] = 1). The
OC2A value will not be visible on the port pin unless the data direction for the pin is set to output. The
waveform generated will have a maximum frequency of fOC2A = fclk_I/O/2 when OCR2A is set to zero
(0x00). The waveform frequency is defined by the following equation:
�OCnx =
�clk_I/O
2 ⋅�⋅1 + OCRnx
The N variable represents the prescale factor (1, 8, 32, 64, 128, 256, or 1024).
As for the Normal mode of operation, the TOV2 Flag is set in the same timer clock cycle that the counter
counts from MAX to 0x00.
22.7.3
Fast PWM Mode
The fast Pulse-Width Modulation (fast PWM) mode (WGM2[2:0] = 0x3 or 0x7) provides a high frequency
PWM waveform generation option. The fast PWM differs from the other PWM option by its single-slope
operation. The counter counts from BOTTOM to TOP then restarts from BOTTOM. TOP is defined as
0xFF when WGM2[2:0] = 0x3, and OCR2A when WGM2[2:0] = 0x7. In non-inverting Compare Output
mode, the Output Compare (OC2x) is cleared on the compare match between TCNT2 and OCR2x and
set at BOTTOM. In inverting Compare Output mode, the output is set on compare match and cleared at
BOTTOM. Due to the single-slope operation, the operating frequency of the fast PWM mode can be twice
as high as the phase correct PWM mode that uses dual-slope operation. This high frequency makes the
fast PWM mode well suited for power regulation, rectification, and DAC applications. High frequency
allows physically small sized external components (coils, capacitors), and therefore reduces total system
cost.
In fast PWM mode, the counter is incremented until the counter value matches the TOP value. The
counter is then cleared at the following timer clock cycle. The timing diagram for the fast PWM mode is
depicted in the following figure. The TCNT2 value is in the timing diagram shown as a histogram for

The Timer/Counter Overflow flag (TOV2) is set each time the counter reaches TOP. If the interrupt is
enabled, the interrupt handler routine can be used for updating the compare value.
In fast PWM mode, the compare unit allows generation of PWM waveforms on the OC2x pin. Setting the
COM2x1:0 bits to two will produce a non-inverted PWM and an inverted PWM output can be generated
by setting the COM2x[1:0] to three. TOP is defined as 0xFF when WGM2[2:0] = 0x3, and OCR2A when
MGM2[2:0] = 0x7. The actual OC2x value will only be visible on the port pin if the data direction for the
port pin is set as output. The PWM waveform is generated by setting (or clearing) the OC2x register at
the compare match between OCR2x and TCNT2, and clearing (or setting) the OC2x register at the timer
clock cycle the counter is cleared (changes from TOP to BOTTOM).
The PWM frequency for the output can be calculated by the following equation:
�OCnxPWM = �clk_I/O
�⋅256
The N variable represents the prescale factor (1, 8, 32, 64, 128, 256, or 1024).
The extreme values for the OCR2A register represent special cases when generating a PWM waveform
output in the fast PWM mode. If the OCR2A is set equal to BOTTOM, the output will be a narrow spike for
each MAX+1 timer clock cycle. Setting the OCR2A equal to MAX will result in a constantly high or low
output (depending on the polarity of the output set by the COM2A[1:0] bits).
A frequency (with 50% duty cycle) waveform output in fast PWM mode can be achieved by setting OC2x
to toggle its logical level on each compare match (COM2x[1:0] = 1). The waveform generated will have a
maximum frequency of foc2 = fclk_I/O/2 when OCR2A is set to zero. This feature is similar to the OC2A
toggle in CTC mode, except the double buffer feature of the output compare unit is enabled in the fast
PWM mode.

22.7.4
Phase Correct PWM Mode
The phase correct PWM mode (WGM2[2:0] = 0x1 or 0x5) provides a high resolution phase correct PWM
waveform generation option. The phase correct PWM mode is based on a dual-slope operation. The
counter counts repeatedly from BOTTOM to TOP and then from TOP to BOTTOM. TOP is defined as
0xFF when WGM2[2:0] = 0x3, and OCR2A when MGM2[2:0] = 7. In non-inverting Compare Output
mode, the Output Compare (OC2x) is cleared on the compare match between TCNT2 and OCR2x while
counting up, and set on the compare match while down-counting. In inverting Output Compare mode, the
operation is inverted. The dual-slope operation has lower maximum operation frequency than single-
slope operation. However, due to the symmetric feature of the dual-slope PWM modes, these modes are
preferred for motor control applications.
In phase correct PWM mode the counter is incremented until the counter value matches TOP. When the
counter reaches TOP, it changes the count direction. The TCNT2 value will be equal to TOP for one timer
clock cycle. The timing diagram for the phase correct PWM mode is shown in Figure 22-7. The TCNT2
value is in the timing diagram shown as a histogram for illustrating the dual-slope operation. The diagram
includes non-inverted and inverted PWM outputs. The small horizontal line marks on the TCNT2 slopes
represent compare matches between OCR2x and TCNT2.

setting (or clearing) the OC2x register at compare match between OCR2x and TCNT2 when the counter
decrements. The PWM frequency for the output when using phase correct PWM can be calculated by the
following equation:
�OCnxPCPWM = �clk_I/O
�⋅510
The N variable represents the prescale factor (1, 8, 32, 64, 128, 256, or 1024).
The extreme values for the OCR2A represent special cases when generating a PWM waveform output in
the phase correct PWM mode. If the OCR2A is set equal to BOTTOM, the output will be continuously low
and if set equal to MAX the output will be continuously high for non-inverted PWM mode. For inverted
PWM the output will have the opposite logic values.
At the very start of period 2 in the above figure OC2x has a transition from high to low even though there
is no compare match. The point of this transition is to guarantee symmetry around BOTTOM. There are
two cases that give a transition without compare match.
•
OCR2A changes its value from MAX, as shown in the preceding figure. When the OCR2A value is
MAX the OC2 pin value is the same as the result of a down-counting compare match. To ensure
symmetry around BOTTOM the OC2 value at MAX must correspond to the result of an up-counting
Compare Match.
•
The timer starts counting from a value higher than the one in OCR2A, and for that reason misses
the compare match and hence the OC2 change that would have happened on the way up.

Timer/Counter Timing Diagrams
The following figures show the timer/counter in Synchronous mode, and the timer clock (clkT2) is
therefore shown as a clock enable signal. In Asynchronous mode, clkI/O should be replaced by the timer/
counter oscillator clock. The figures include information on when interrupt flags are set. The following
figure contains timing data for basic timer/counter operation. The figure shows the count sequence close
to the MAX value in all modes other than phase correct PWM mode.

•
When switching between asynchronous and synchronous clocking of TC2, the registers TCNT2,
OCR2x, and TCCR2x might be corrupted. A safe procedure for switching clock source is:
1.
Disable the TC2 interrupts by clearing OCIE2x and TOIE2.
2.
Select clock source by setting AS2 as appropriate.
3.
Write new values to TCNT2, OCR2x, and TCCR2x.
4.
To switch to asynchronous operation: Wait for TCN2xUB, OCR2xUB, and TCR2xUB.
5.
Clear the TC2 interrupt flags.
6.
Enable interrupts, if needed.
•
The CPU main clock frequency must be more than four times the oscillator frequency.
•
When writing to one of the registers TCNT2, OCR2x, or TCCR2x, the value is transferred to a
temporary register and latched after two positive edges on TOSC1. The user should not write a
new value before the contents of the temporary register have been transferred to its destination.
Each of the five mentioned registers has its individual temporary register, which means that e.g.
writing to TCNT2 does not disturb an OCR2x write in progress. The Asynchronous Status Register
(ASSR) indicates that a transfer to the destination register has taken place.
•
When entering Power-Save or ADC Noise Reduction mode after having written to TCNT2, OCR2x,
or TCCR2x, the user must wait until the written register has been updated if TC2 is used to wake
up the device. Otherwise, the MCU will enter sleep mode before the changes are effective. This is
particularly important if any of the Output Compare2 interrupts is used to wake up the device, since
the Output Compare function is disabled during writing to OCR2x or TCNT2. If the write cycle is not
finished, and the MCU enters sleep mode before the corresponding OCR2xUB bit returns to zero,
the device will never receive a compare match interrupt, and the MCU will not wake up.
•
If TC2 is used to wake the device up from Power-Save or ADC Noise Reduction mode, precautions
must be taken if the user wants to re-enter one of these modes: If re-entering sleep mode within the
TOSC1 cycle, the interrupt will immediately occur and the device wakes up again. The result is
multiple interrupts and wake-ups within one TOSC1 cycle from the first interrupt. If the user is in
doubt whether the time before re-entering Power-save or ADC Noise Reduction mode is sufficient,
the following algorithm can be used to ensure that one TOSC1 cycle has elapsed:
1.
Write a value to TCCR2x, TCNT2, or OCR2x.
2.
Wait until the corresponding update busy flag in ASSR returns to zero.
3.
Enter Power-Save or ADC Noise Reduction mode.
•
When the asynchronous operation is selected, the 32.768 kHz oscillator for TC2 is always running,
except in Power-Down and Standby modes. After a Power-up Reset or wake-up from Power-Down
or Standby mode, the user should be aware of the fact that this oscillator might take as long as one
second to stabilize. The user is advised to wait for at least one second before using TC2 after
power-up or wake-up from Power-Down or Standby mode. The contents of all TC2 registers must
be considered lost after a wake-up from Power-Down or Standby mode due to unstable clock signal
upon start-up, no matter whether the oscillator is in use or a clock signal is applied to the TOSC1
pin.
•
Description of wake up from Power-Save or ADC Noise Reduction mode when the timer is clocked
asynchronously: When the interrupt condition is met, the wake up process is started on the
following cycle of the timer clock, that is, the timer is always advanced by at least one before the
processor can read the counter value. After wake-up, the MCU is halted for four cycles, it executes
the interrupt routine, and resumes execution from the instruction following SLEEP.
•
Reading of the TCNT2 register shortly after wake-up from Power-Save may give an incorrect result.
Since TCNT2 is clocked on the asynchronous TOSC clock, reading TCNT2 must be done through
a register synchronized to the internal I/O clock domain. Synchronization takes place for every

rising TOSC1 edge. When waking up from Power-Save mode, and the I/O clock (clkI/O) again
becomes active, TCNT2 will read as the previous value (before entering sleep) until the next rising
TOSC1 edge. The phase of the TOSC clock after waking up from Power-Save mode is essentially
unpredictable, as it depends on the wake-up time. The recommended procedure for reading
TCNT2 is thus as follows:
8.1.
Wait for the corresponding update busy flag to be cleared.
8.2.
Read TCNT2.
•
During asynchronous operation, the synchronization of the interrupt flags for the asynchronous
timer takes three processor cycles plus one timer cycle. The timer is therefore advanced by at least
one before the processor can read the timer value causing the setting of the interrupt flag. The
output compare pin is changed on the timer clock and is not synchronized to the processor clock.

The clock source for TC2 is named clkT2S. It is by default connected to the main system I/O clock clkI/O.
By writing a '1' to the Asynchronous TC2 bit in the Asynchronous Status Register (ASSR.AS2), TC2 is
asynchronously clocked from the TOSC1 pin. This enables the use of TC2 as a Real Time Counter
(RTC). When AS2 is set, pins TOSC1 and TOSC2 are disconnected from Port B. A crystal can then be
connected between the TOSC1 and TOSC2 pins to serve as an independent clock source for TC2. The
oscillator is optimized for use with a 32.768 kHz crystal.
For TC2, the possible prescaled selections are: clkT2S/8, clkT2S/32, clkT2S/64, clkT2S/128, clkT2S/256, and
clkT2S/1024. Additionally, clkT2S, as well as 0 (stop), may be selected. The prescaler is reset by writing a
'1' to the Prescaler Reset TC2 bit in the General TC2 Control Register (GTCCR.PSRASY). This allows
the user to operate with a defined prescaler.

Bits 7:6 – COM2A[1:0] Compare Output Mode for Channel A
These bits control the Output Compare pin (OC2A) behavior. If one or both of the COM2A[1:0] bits are
set, the OC2A output overrides the normal port functionality of the I/O pin it is connected to. However,
note that the Data Direction Register (DDR) bit corresponding to the OC2A pin must be set in order to
enable the output driver.
When OC2A is connected to the pin, the function of the COM2A[1:0] bits depends on the WGM2[2:0] bit
setting. The table below shows the COM2A[1:0] bit functionality when the WGM2[2:0] bits are set to a
normal or CTC mode (non-PWM).

Set OC0B on compare match, clear OC0B at BOTTOM, (inverting mode)
Note:

A special case occurs when OCR2B equals TOP and COM2B[1] is set. In this case, the compare
match is ignored, but the set or clear is done at TOP. Refer to Fast PWM Mode for details.
The table below shows the COM2B[1:0] bit functionality when the WGM2[2:0] bits are set to phase
correct PWM mode.

Bits 1:0 – WGM2[1:0] Waveform Generation Mode
Combined with the WGM2[2] bit found in the TCCR2B register, these bits control the counting sequence
of the counter, the source for maximum (TOP) counter value, and what type of waveform generation to be
used. Modes of operation supported by the Timer/Counter unit are: Normal mode (counter), Clear Timer
on Compare Match (CTC) mode, and two types of Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) modes (see Modes of
Operation).

Bit 7 – FOC2A Force Output Compare A
The FOC2A bit is only active when the WGM bits specify a non-PWM mode.
To ensure compatibility with future devices, this bit must be set to zero when TCCR2B is written when
operating in PWM mode. When writing a logical one to the FOC2A bit, an immediate compare match is
forced on the waveform generation unit. The OC2A output is changed according to its COM2A[1:0] bits
setting. Note that the FOC2A bit is implemented as a strobe. Therefore it is the value present in the
COM2A[1:0] bits that determines the effect of the forced compare.
A FOC2A strobe will not generate any interrupt, nor will it clear the timer in CTC mode using OCR2A as
TOP.
The FOC2A bit is always read as zero.
Bit 6 – FOC2B Force Output Compare B
The FOC2B bit is only active when the WGM bits specify a non-PWM mode.
To ensure compatibility with future devices, this bit must be set to zero when TCCR2B is written when
operating in PWM mode. When writing a logical one to the FOC2B bit, an immediate compare match is
forced on the waveform generation unit. The OC2B output is changed according to its COM2B[1:0] bits

Bits 7:0 – TCNT2[7:0] Timer/Counter 2 Counter Value
The Timer/Counter register gives direct access, both for read and write operations, to the Timer/Counter
unit 8-bit counter. Writing to the TCNT2 register blocks (removes) the compare match on the following
timer clock. Modifying the counter (TCNT2) while the counter is running, introduces a risk of missing a
compare match between TCNT2 and the OCR2x registers.

Bit 2 – OCF2B Timer/Counter 2, Output Compare B Match Flag
The OCF2B bit is set (one) when a compare match occurs between the timer/counter2 and the data in
Output Compare Register2 (OCR2B). OCF2B is cleared by hardware when executing the corresponding
interrupt handling vector. Alternatively, OCF2B is cleared by writing a logic one to the flag. When the I-bit
in SREG, OCIE2B (timer/counter2 compare match interrupt enable), and OCF2B are set (one), the timer/
counter2 compare match interrupt is executed.
Bit 1 – OCF2A Timer/Counter 2, Output Compare A Match Flag
The OCF2A bit is set (one) when a compare match occurs between the timer/counter2 and the data in
Output Compare Register2 (OCRA). OCF2A is cleared by hardware when executing the corresponding
interrupt handling vector. Alternatively, OCF2A is cleared by writing a logic one to the flag. When the I-bit
in SREG, OCIE2A (timer/counter2 compare match interrupt enable), and OCF2A are set (one), the timer/
counter 2 compare match interrupt is executed.
Bit 0 – TOV2 Timer/Counter 2, Overflow Flag
The TOV2 bit is set (one) when an overflow occurs in Timer/Counter 2. TOV2 is cleared by hardware
when executing the corresponding interrupt handling vector. Alternatively, TOV2 is cleared by writing a
logic one to the flag. When the SREG I-bit, TOIE2A (timer/counter 2 overflow interrupt enable), and TOV2
are set (one), the timer/counter 2 overflow interrupt is executed. In PWM mode, this bit is set when timer/
counter 2 changes counting direction at 0x00.

Bit 6 – EXCLK Enable External Clock Input
When EXCLK is written to one, and asynchronous clock is selected, the external clock input buffer is
enabled and an external clock can be input on Timer Oscillator 1 (TOSC1) pin instead of a 32 kHz crystal.
Writing to EXCLK should be done before asynchronous operation is selected. Note that the crystal
oscillator will run only when this bit is zero.
Bit 5 – AS2 Asynchronous Timer/Counter2
When AS2 is written to zero, timer/counter2 is clocked from the I/O clock, clkI/O. When AS2 is written to
one, timer/counter2 is clocked from a crystal oscillator connected to the timer oscillator 1 (TOSC1) pin.
When the value of AS2 is changed, the contents of TCNT2, OCR2A, OCR2B, TCCR2A, and TCCR2B
might be corrupted.
Bit 4 – TCN2UB Timer/Counter2 Update Busy
When timer/counter2 operates asynchronously and TCNT2 is written, this bit becomes set. When TCNT2
has been updated from the temporary storage register, this bit is cleared by hardware. A logical zero in
this bit indicates that TCNT2 is ready to be updated with a new value.
Bit 3 – OCR2AUB Output Compare Register2A Update Busy
When timer/counter2 operates asynchronously and OCR2A is written, this bit becomes set. When
OCR2A has been updated from the temporary storage register, this bit is cleared by hardware. A logical
zero in this bit indicates that OCR2A is ready to be updated with a new value.
Bit 2 – OCR2BUB Output Compare Register2B Update Busy
When timer/counter2 operates asynchronously and OCR2B is written, this bit becomes set. When
OCR2B has been updated from the temporary storage register, this bit is cleared by hardware. A logical
zero in this bit indicates that OCR2B is ready to be updated with a new value.
Bit 1 – TCR2AUB Timer/Counter Control Register2 Update Busy
When timer/counter2 operates asynchronously and TCCR2A is written, this bit becomes set. When
TCCR2A has been updated from the temporary storage register, this bit is cleared by hardware. A logical
zero in this bit indicates that TCCR2A is ready to be updated with a new value.
Bit 0 – TCR2BUB Timer/Counter Control Register2 Update Busy
When timer/counter2 operates asynchronously and TCCR2B is written, this bit becomes set. When
TCCR2B has been updated from the temporary storage register, this bit is cleared by hardware. A logical
zero in this bit indicates that TCCR2B is ready to be updated with a new value.

Bit 7 – TSM Timer/Counter Synchronization Mode
Writing the TSM bit to one activates the Timer/Counter Synchronization mode. In this mode, the value
that is written to the PSRASY and PSRSYNC bits is kept, hence keeping the corresponding prescaler
Reset signals asserted. This ensures that the corresponding timer/counters are halted and can be
configured to the same value without the risk of one of them advancing during configuration. When the
TSM bit is written to zero, the PSRASY and PSRSYNC bits are cleared by hardware, and the timer/
counters start counting simultaneously.
Bit 1 – PSRASY Prescaler Reset Timer/Counter2
When this bit is one, the timer/counter2 prescaler will be reset. This bit is normally cleared immediately by
hardware. If the bit is written when timer/counter2 is operating in Asynchronous mode, the bit will remain
one until the prescaler has been Reset. The bit will not be cleared by hardware if the TSM bit is set.
Bit 0 – PSRSYNC Prescaler Reset
When this bit is one, timer/counter 0, 1 prescaler will be Reset. This bit is normally cleared immediately by
hardware, except if the TSM bit is set. Note that timer/counter 0, 1 share the same prescaler and a Reset
of this prescaler will affect the mentioned timers.

Note:  Refer to the pin-out description and the I/O Port description for SPI pin placement.
The interconnection between master and slave CPUs with SPI is shown in the figure below. The system
consists of two shift registers and a master clock generator. The SPI Master initiates the communication
cycle when pulling low the Slave Select SS pin of the desired slave. Master and slave prepare the data to
be sent in their respective shift registers, and the master generates the required clock pulses on the SCK
line to interchange data. Data is always shifted from master to slave on the Master Out – Slave In (MOSI)
line, and from slave to master on the Master In – Slave Out (MISO) line. After each data packet, the
master will synchronize the slave by pulling high the Slave Select, SS, line.
When configured as a master, the SPI interface has no automatic control of the SS line. This must be
handled by user software before communication can start. When this is done, writing a byte to the SPI
Data register starts the SPI clock generator, and the hardware shifts the eight bits into the slave. After
shifting one byte, the SPI clock generator stops, setting the end of Transmission Flag (SPIF). If the SPI
Interrupt Enable bit (SPIE) in the SPCR register is set, an interrupt is requested. The master may
continue to shift the next byte by writing it into SPDR, or signal the end of packet by pulling high the Slave
Select, SS line. The last incoming byte will be kept in the Buffer register for later use.
When configured as a slave, the SPI interface will remain sleeping with MISO tri-stated as long as the SS
pin is driven high. In this state, the software may update the contents of the SPDR, but the data will not
be shifted out by incoming clock pulses on the SCK pin until the SS pin is driven low. As one byte has
been completely shifted, the end of transmission flag, SPIF is set. If the SPIE in the SPCR register is set,

an interrupt is requested. The slave may continue to place new data to be sent to SPDR before reading
the incoming data. The last incoming byte will be kept in the Buffer register for later use.
Figure 23-2. SPI Master-Slave Interconnection
SHIFT
ENABLE
The system is single buffered in the transmit direction and double buffered in the receive direction. This
means that bytes to be transmitted cannot be written to the SPI Data register before the entire shift cycle
is completed. When receiving data, however, a received character must be read from the SPI Data
register before the next character has been completely shifted in. Otherwise, the first byte is lost.
In SPI Slave mode, the control logic will sample the incoming signal of the SCK pin. To ensure correct
sampling of the clock signal, the minimum low and high periods should be longer than two CPU clock
cycles.
When the SPI is enabled, the data direction of the MOSI, MISO, SCK, and SS pins is overridden
according to the table below. For more details on automatic port overrides, refer to the I/O Ports
description.

Note:  1. See the I/O Ports description for how to define the SPI pin directions.
The following code examples show how to initialize the SPI as a master and how to perform a simple
transmission. DDR_SPI in the examples must be replaced by the actual Data Direction register controlling
the SPI pins. DD_MOSI, DD_MISO, and DD_SCK must be replaced by the actual data direction bits for
these pins, for example, if MOSI is placed on pin PB5, replace DD_MOSI with DDB5 and DDR_SPI with

```c
DDRB.
